        <p>This fall, as performing arts students moved into
            apartments, Airbnbs and condos, they set up
            their studios, pushed furniture aside and hung
            makeshift backdrops.</p>
        <p>A “really angsty version of [Taylor Swift’s] ‘Illicit
            Affairs’” blasts from a Cape Cod house shared by
            six Northwestern opera students this quarter. “You
            actually are catching a moment of peacefulness right
            now; there aren’t many times in the afternoon where
            there’s not singing in the house,” says Bienen second-
            year McKenna Troy (which is, in part, due to their
            agreed-upon singing hours: from the time classes begin
            in the morning to 10 p.m.).</p>

    <article class="article-body">
        <p>It’s also not uncommon for these students to take
            classes together, gathering in the piano room for choir.
            When they’re not catching a Zoom call, the group makes
            TikToks, one of which made its way to For You page
            stardom. Although stereotypical, Troy says “watching
            Glee together is wonderful.”</p>
        <p>Bienen and Communication second-year Ranna
            Shahbazi also studies Vocal Performance with Opera,
            but she shares an Airbnb with three non-voice majors,
            who frequently imitate her singing rather than joining
            in. For second-years who don’t have access to practice
            space on campus this quarter, learning at home means
            practicing at home. Since Shahbazi says she works best
            at night, her three roommates say she “start[s] howling
            at 11:30.”</p>
        <p>One of Shahbazi’s roommates, Communication
            second-year Maggie Lezcano, says the opera student
            “brings a lot of laughs to the house.” According to
            Lezcano, Shahbazi’s instruction requires stomping,
            which “literally just sounds like there’s someone
            doing construction,” and watching full-fledged opera
            performances while the housemates are trying to
            eat dinner.</p>

        <p>Also in Evanston this quarter are SESP second-year
            Ben Finkelstein and his roommate, Communication
            second-year Andy Hartman. Finkelstein says Hartman
            converted the living room into his ballet studio for
            the quarter, pushing the couch aside to make room
            for the barre he ordered. Since they signed their
            lease last-minute, the kitchen has frequent plumbing
            issues. Though Finkelstein doesn’t think twice about
            Hartman’s performing arts classes, he expected the
            plumber to when he arrived just as Hartman was
            warming up for ballet class.</p>

        <p>“It just looked like a scene out of a comedy show,”
            Finkelstein says. “You have the plumber making a ton
            of noise with all of his tools and everything in the
            kitchen, and he’s trying to dance in the living room ...
            Then, in the end, he goes ‘Oh, sorry, were you doing
            something this whole time?’ It was just a mess.”</p>
        <p>In nearby Rogers Park, Medill first-year Madison
            Bruno shares an Airbnb with two theatre students,
            first-years Adelaide Ray Young and Kate Davis. Young,
            an aspiring screen actress, often films audition tapes.
            She moved a couch out of the office to make room for
            her equipment, saying, “just the theatre things,” when
            their landlord stopped by to see how the girls were
            settled in.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="article-body">

        <p>When Young prepares audition films, pulls out her
            backdrop and goes over her lines, everyone in the house
            takes part in the process. Additionally, Bruno says Young
            works on talents like gymnastics and skateboarding to
            boost her résumé. Bruno, a competitive cheerleader of
            eight years, often teaches Young a thing or two.</p>
        <p>Though Young keeps up her skills for the screen,
            Davis is more interested in musical theatre and is
            enrolled in Basic Acting.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know what is going on in that class; they
            just start with clapping every time and then we hear
            her just repeating like the same word over and over,
            which I’m assuming is an acting exercise,” Young says
            after imitating Davis’ applause.</p>
        <p>Bruno actually has a discussion section during just
            that class. “Every time I unmute, she’s making weird
            noises,” Bruno says, admitting that she’s given up
            speaking altogether.</p>
        <p>“I always have to be kind of in the loop of when
            she’ll be doing those classes because we have quizzes
            or tests, [and] they’re not the time to overlap them,”
            Young says.</p>
        <p>“Don’t fight it,” Bruno says about the experience.
            “Just take it in ... and invest in some good headphones.”</p>
